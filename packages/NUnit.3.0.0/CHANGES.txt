NUnit 3.0.0 Final Release - November 15, 2015

Issues Resolved

 * 635 Mono 4.0 Support

NUnit 3.0.0 Release Candidate 3 - November 13, 2015

Engine

 * The engine now only sets the config file for project.nunit to project.config if project.config exists. Otherwise, each assembly uses its own config, provided it is run in a separate AppDomain by itself. 

   NOTE: It is not possible for multiple assemblies in the same AppDomain to use different configs. This is not an NUnit limitation, it's just how configs work!

Issues Resolved

 * 856 Extensions support for third party runners in NUnit 3.0
 * 1003 Delete TeamCityEventHandler as it is not used
 * 1015 Specifying .nunit project and --framework on command line causes crash
 * 1017 Remove Assert.Multiple from framework

NUnit 3.0.0 Release Candidate 2 - November 8, 2015

Engine

 * The IDriverFactory extensibility interface has been modified.
 
Issues Resolved

 * 970  Define PARALLEL in CF build of nunitlite
 * 978  It should be possible to determine version of NUnit using nunit console tool

 * 993  Give error message when a regex filter is used with NUnit V2
 * 997  Add missing XML Documentation
 * 1008 NUnitLite namespace not updated in the NuGet Packages

NUnit 3.0.0 Release Candidate - November 1, 2015

Framework

 * The portable build now supports ASP.NET 5 and the new Core CLR.
 
   NOTE: The `nunit3-console` runner cannot run tests that reference the portable build.
   You may run such tests using NUnitLite or a platform-specific runner.

 * `TestCaseAttribute` and `TestCaseData` now allow modifying the test name without replacing it entirely.
 * The Silverlight packages are now separate downloads.

NUnitLite

 * The NUnitLite runner now produces the same output display and XML results as the console runner.
 
Engine

 * The format of the XML result file has been finalized and documented.

Console Runner

 * The console runner program is now called `nunit3-console`.
 * Console runner output has been modified so that the summary comes at the end, to reduce the need for scrolling.

Issues Resolved

 *  59 Length of generated test names should be limited

NUnit 3.0.0 Beta 5 - October 16, 2015

Framework

 * Parameterized test cases now support nullable arguments.
 * The NUnit framework may now be built for the .NET Core framework. Note that this is only available through building the source code. A binary will be available in the next release.

Engine

 * The engine now runs multiple test assemblies in parallel by default
 * The output XML now includes more information about the test run, including the text of the command used, any engine settings and the filter used to select tests.
 * Extensions may now specify data in an identifying attribute, for use by the engine in deciding whether to load that extension.


Console Runner

 * The console now displays all settings used by the engine to run tests as well as the filter used to select tests.
 * The console runner accepts a new option --maxagents. If multiple assemblies are run in separate processes, this value may be used to limit the number that are executed simultaneously in parallel.
 * The console runner no longer accepts the --include and --exclude options. Instead, the new --where option provides a more general way to express which tests will be executed, such as --where "cat==Fast && Priority==High". See the docs for details of the syntax.
 * The new --debug option causes NUnit to break in the debugger immediately before tests are run. This simplifies debugging, especially when the test is run in a separate process.

NUnit 3.0.0 Beta 3 - July 15, 2015

Framework

 * The RangeAttribute has been extended to support more data types including 
   uint, long and ulong
 * Added platform support for Windows 10 and fixed issues with Windows 8 and
   8.1 support
 * Added async support to the portable version of NUnit Framework
 * The named members of the TestCaseSource and ValueSource attributes must now be
   static.
 * RandomAttribute has been extended to add support for new data types including 
   uint, long, ulong, short, ushort, float, byte and sbyte
 * TestContext.Random has also been extended to add support for new data types including 
   uint, long, ulong, short, ushort, float, byte, sbyte and decimal
 * Removed the dependency on Microsoft.Bcl.Async from the NUnit Framework assembly
   targeting .NET 4.0. If you want to write async tests in .NET 4.0, you will need
   to reference the NuGet package yourself.

   devices and similar situations where reduced functionality is compensated 
   for by reduced size and simplicity of usage. See
   https://github.com/nunit/dev/wiki/Core-Engine for more information.

NUnit 3.0.0 Beta 1 - March 25, 2015

General

 * There is now a master windows installer for the framework, engine and console runner.

Framework

 * We no longer create a separate framework build for .NET 3.5. The 2.0 and
   3.5 builds were essentially the same, so the former should now be used 
   under both runtimes.
 * A new Constraint, DictionaryContainsKeyConstraint, may be used to test
   that a specified key is present in a dictionary.
 * LevelOfParallelizationAttribute has been renamed to LevelOfParallelismAttribute.
 * The Silverlight runner now displays output in color and includes any
   text output created by the tests.
 * The class and method names of each test are included in the output xml
   where applicable.
 * String arguments used in test case names are now truncated to 40 rather
   than 20 characters.

Engine

 * The engine API has now been finalized. It permits specifying a minimum 
   version of the engine that a runner is able to use. The best installed 
   version of the engine will be loaded. Third-party runners may override
   the selection process by including a copy of the engine in their 
   installation directory and specifying that it must be used.
 * The V2 framework driver now uses the event listener and test listener
   passed to it by the runner. This corrects several outstanding issues
   caused by events not being received and allows selecting V2 tests to
   be run from the command-line, in the same way that V3 tests are selected.

Console

 * The console now defaults to not using shadowcopy. There is a new option 
   --shadowcopy to turn it on if needed.

Issues Resolved

 * 224	Silverlight Support
 * 318	TestActionAttribute: Retrieving the TestFixture
 * 428	Add ExpectedExceptionAttribute to C# samples

 * 541	Console help doesn't indicate defaults

NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 5 - January 30, 2015

General

 * A Windows installer is now included in the release packages.
 
Framework

 * TestCaseAttribute now allows arguments with default values to be omitted. Additionaly, it accepts a Platform property to specify the platforms on which the test case should be run.
 * TestFixture and TestCase attributes now enforce the requirement that a reason needs to be provided when ignoring a test.
 * SetUp, TearDown, OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown methods may now be async.
 * String arguments over 20 characters in length are truncated when used as part of a test name.

Engine

 * The engine is now extensible using Mono.Addins. In this release, extension points are provided for FrameworkDrivers, ProjectLoaders and OutputWriters. The following addins are bundled as a part of NUnit:
   * A FrameworkDriver that allows running NUnit V2 tests under NUnit 3.0.
   * ProjectLoaders for NUnit and Visual Studio projects.
   * An OutputWriter that creates XML output in NUnit V2 format.
 * DomainUsage now defaults to Multiple if not specified by the runner

Console

 * 442  Add --stoponerror option back to nunit-console.
 * 456  Fix memory leak in RuntimeFramework.
 * 459  Remove the Mixed Platforms build configuration.
 * 468  Change default domain usage to multiple.
 * 469  Truncate string arguments in test names in order to limit the length.

   * NUnit (.nunit)
   * Visual Studio C# projects (.csproj)
   * Visual Studio F# projects (.vjsproj)
   * Visual Studio Visual Basic projects (.vbproj)
   * Visual Studio solutions (.sln)
   * Legacy C++ and Visual JScript projects (.csproj and .vjsproj) are also supported
   * Support for the current C++ format (.csxproj) is not yet available
 * Creation of output files like TestResult.xml in various formats is now a
   service of the engine, available to any runner.

NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 3 - November 29, 2014

Breaking Changes

 * NUnitLite tests must reference both the nunit.framework and nunitlite assemblies.

Framework

 * The NUnit and NUnitLite frameworks have now been merged. There is no longer any distinction
   between them in terms of features, although some features are not available on all platforms.
 * The release includes two new framework builds: compact framework 3.5 and portable. The portable
   library is compatible with .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5.0, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.1,
   Windows Phone Silverlight 8, Mono for Android and MonoTouch.
 * A number of previously unsupported features are available for the Compact Framework:
    - Generic methods as tests
    - RegexConstraint
    - TimeoutAttribute
    - FileAssert, DirectoryAssert and file-related constraints

Engine

 * The logic of runtime selection has now changed so that each assembly runs by default
   in a separate process using the runtime for which it was built.
 * On 64-bit systems, each test process is automatically created as 32-bit or 64-bit,
   depending on the platform specified for the test assembly. 

Console

 * The console runner now runs tests in a separate process per assembly by default. They may
   still be run in process or in a single separate process by use of command-line options.
 * The console runner now starts in the highest version of the .NET runtime available, making
   it simpler to debug tests by specifying that they should run in-process on the command-line.
 * The -x86 command-line option is provided to force execution in a 32-bit process on a 64-bit system.
 * A writeability check is performed for each output result file before trying to run the tests.
 * The -teamcity option is now supported.

Breaking Changes

 * The console runner no longer displays test results in the debugger.
 * The NUnitLite compact framework 2.0 build has been removed.
 * All addin support has been removed from the framework. Documentation of NUnit 3.0 extensibility features will be published in time for the beta release. In the interim, please ask for support on the nunit-discuss list.

General

 * A separate solution has been created for Linux

NUnit 2.9.7 - August 8, 2014

Breaking Changes

 * NUnit no longer supports void async test methods. You should use a Task return Type instead.
