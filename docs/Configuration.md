Configuration
===

When connecting to Redis version 6 or above with an ACL configured, your ACL user needs to at least have permissions to run the ECHO command. We run this command to verify that we have a valid connection to the Redis service.
Because there are lots of different ways to configure redis, StackExchange.Redis offers a rich configuration model, which is invoked when calling `Connect` (or `ConnectAsync`):

```csharp
var conn = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(configuration);
```

The `configuration` here can be either:

- a `ConfigurationOptions` instance
- a `string` representing the configuration

The latter is *basically* a tokenized form of the former.

Basic Configuration Strings
-

The *simplest* configuration example is just the host name:

```csharp
var conn = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect("localhost");
```

This will connect to a single server on the local machine using the default redis port (6379). Additional options are simply appended (comma-delimited). Ports are represented with a colon (`:`) as is usual. Configuration *options* include an `=` after the name. For example:

```csharp
var conn = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect("redis0:6380,redis1:6380,allowAdmin=true");
```

If you specify a serviceName in the connection string, it will trigger sentinel mode. This example will connect to a sentinel server on the local machine
using the default sentinel port (26379), discover the current primary server for the `myprimary` service and return a managed connection
pointing to that primary server that will automatically be updated if the primary changes:

```csharp
var conn = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect("localhost,serviceName=myprimary");
```

An overview of mapping between the `string` and `ConfigurationOptions` representation is shown below, but you can switch between them trivially:

```csharp
ConfigurationOptions options = ConfigurationOptions.Parse(configString);
```

or:

```csharp
string configString = options.ToString();
```

A common usage is to store the *basic* details in a string, and then apply specific details at runtime:

```csharp
string configString = GetRedisConfiguration();
var options = ConfigurationOptions.Parse(configString);
options.ClientName = GetAppName(); // only known at runtime
options.AllowAdmin = true;
conn = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(options);
```

Microsoft Azure Redis example with password

```csharp
var conn = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect("contoso5.redis.cache.windows.net,ssl=true,password=...");
```

Configuration Options
---

The `ConfigurationOptions` object has a wide range of properties, all of which are fully documented in intellisense. Some of the more common options to use include:

Additional code-only options:
- ReconnectRetryPolicy (`IReconnectRetryPolicy`) - Default: `ReconnectRetryPolicy = ExponentialRetry(ConnectTimeout / 2);`
  - Determines how often a multiplexer will try to reconnect after a failure
- BacklogPolicy - Default: `BacklogPolicy = BacklogPolicy.Default;`
  - Determines how commands will be queued (or not) during a disconnect, for sending when it's available again
- BeforeSocketConnect - Default: `null`
  - Allows modifying a `Socket` before connecting (for advanced scenarios)
- SslClientAuthenticationOptions (`netcoreapp3.1`/`net5.0` and higher) - Default: `null`
  - Allows specifying exact options for SSL/TLS authentication against a server (e.g. cipher suites, protocols, etc.) - overrides all other SSL configuration options. This is a `Func<string, SslClientAuthenticationOptions>` which receives the host (or `SslHost` if set) to get the options for. If `null` is returned from the `Func`, it's the same as this property not being set at all when connecting.
- SocketManager - Default: `SocketManager.Shared`: 
  - The thread pool to use for scheduling work to and from the socket connected to Redis, one of...
    - `SocketManager.Shared`: Use a shared dedicated thread pool for _all_ multiplexers (defaults to 10 threads) - best balance for most scenarios.
    - `SocketManager.ThreadPool`: Use the build-in .NET thread pool for scheduling. This can perform better for very small numbers of cores or with large apps on large machines that need to use more than 10 threads (total, across all multiplexers) under load. **Important**: this option isn't the default because it's subject to thread pool growth/starvation and if for example synchronous calls are waiting on a redis command to come back to unblock other threads, stalls/hangs can result. Use with caution, especially if you have sync-over-async work in play.
- HeartbeatInterval - Default: `1000ms`
  - Allows running the heartbeat more often which importantly includes timeout evaluation for async commands. For example if you have a 50ms async command timeout, we're only actually checking it during the heartbeat (once per second by default), so it's possible 50-1050ms pass _before we notice it timed out_. If you want more fidelity in that check and to observe that a server failed faster, you can lower this to run the heartbeat more often to achieve that. 
  - **Note: heartbeats are not free and that's why the default is 1 second. There is additional overhead to running this more often simply because it does some work each time it fires.**
- LibraryName - Default: `SE.Redis` (unless a `DefaultOptionsProvider` specifies otherwise)
  - The library name to use with `CLIENT SETINFO` when setting the library name/version on the connection

Tokens in the configuration string are comma-separated; any without an `=` sign are assumed to be redis server endpoints. Endpoints without an explicit port will use 6379 if ssl is not enabled, and 6380 if ssl is enabled.
Tokens starting with `$` are taken to represent command maps, for example: `$config=cfg`.

Obsolete Configuration Options
---
These options are parsed in connection strings for backwards compatibility (meaning they do not error as invalid), but no longer have any effect.

| Configuration string   | `ConfigurationOptions` | Previous Default | Previous Meaning |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| responseTimeout={int} | `ResponseTimeout` | `SyncTimeout` | Time (ms) to decide whether the socket is unhealthy |
| writeBuffer={int} | `WriteBuffer` | `4096` | Size of the output buffer |

Automatic and Manual Configuration
---

In many common scenarios, StackExchange.Redis will automatically configure a lot of settings, including the server type and version, connection timeouts, and primary/replica relationships. Sometimes, though, the commands for this have been disabled on the redis server. In this case, it is useful to provide more information:

```csharp
ConfigurationOptions config = new ConfigurationOptions
{
    EndPoints =
    {
        { "redis0", 6379 },
        { "redis1", 6380 }
    },
    CommandMap = CommandMap.Create(new HashSet<string>
    { // EXCLUDE a few commands
        "INFO", "CONFIG", "CLUSTER",
        "PING", "ECHO", "CLIENT"
    }, available: false),
    KeepAlive = 180,
    DefaultVersion = new Version(2, 8, 8),
    Password = "changeme"
};
```

Which is equivalent to the command string:

```config
redis0:6379,redis1:6380,keepAlive=180,version=2.8.8,$CLIENT=,$CLUSTER=,$CONFIG=,$ECHO=,$INFO=,$PING=
```
Renaming Commands
---

A slightly unusual feature of redis is that you can disable and/or rename individual commands. As per the previous example, this is done via the `CommandMap`, but instead of passing a `HashSet<string>` to `Create()` (to indicate the available or unavailable commands), you pass a `Dictionary<string,string>`. All commands not mentioned in the dictionary are assumed to be enabled and not renamed. A `null` or blank value records that the command is disabled. For example:

```csharp
var commands = new Dictionary<string,string> {
        { "info", null }, // disabled
        { "select", "use" }, // renamed to SQL equivalent for some reason
};
var options = new ConfigurationOptions {
    // ...
    CommandMap = CommandMap.Create(commands),
    // ...
}
```

The above is equivalent to (in the connection string):

```config
$INFO=,$SELECT=use
```

Redis Server Permissions
---
If the user you're connecting to Redis with is limited, it still needs to have certain commands enabled for the StackExchange.Redis to succeed in connecting. The client uses:
- `AUTH` to authenticate
- `CLIENT` to set the client name
- `INFO` to understand server topology/settings
- `ECHO` for heartbeat. 
- (Optional) `SUBSCRIBE` to observe change events
- (Optional) `CONFIG` to get/understand settings
- (Optional) `CLUSTER` to get cluster nodes
- (Optional) `SENTINEL` only for Sentinel servers
- (Optional) `GET` to determine tie breakers
- (Optional) `SET` (_only_ if `INFO` is disabled) to see if we're writable
 
For example, a common _very_ minimal configuration ACL on the server (non-cluster) would be:
```bash
-@all +@pubsub +@read +echo +info
```

Note that if you choose to disable access to the above commands, it needs to be done via the `CommandMap` and not only the ACL on the server (otherwise we'll attempt the command and fail the handshake). Also, if any of the these commands are disabled, some functionality may be diminished or broken.

twemproxy
---

[twemproxy](https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy) is a tool that allows multiple redis instances to be used as though it were a single server, with inbuilt sharding and fault tolerance (much like redis cluster, but implemented separately). The feature-set available to Twemproxy is reduced. To avoid having to configure this manually, the `Proxy` option can be used:

```csharp
var options = new ConfigurationOptions
{
    EndPoints = { "my-server" },
    Proxy = Proxy.Twemproxy
};
```

envoyproxy
---
[Envoyproxy](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy) is a tool that allows to front a redis cluster with a set of proxies, with inbuilt discovery and fault tolerance. The feature-set available to Envoyproxy is reduced. To avoid having to configure this manually, the `Proxy` option can be used:
```csharp
var options = new ConfigurationOptions+{
    EndPoints = { "my-proxy1", "my-proxy2", "my-proxy3" },
    Proxy = Proxy.Envoyproxy
};
```


Tiebreakers and Configuration Change Announcements
---

Normally StackExchange.Redis will resolve primary/replica nodes automatically. However, if you are not using a management tool such as redis-sentinel or redis cluster, there is a chance that occasionally you will get multiple primary nodes (for example, while resetting a node for maintenance it may reappear on the network as a primary). To help with this, StackExchange.Redis can use the notion of a *tie-breaker* - which is only used when multiple primaries are detected (not including redis cluster, where multiple primaries are *expected*). For compatibility with BookSleeve, this defaults to the key named `"__Booksleeve_TieBreak"` (always in database 0). This is used as a crude voting mechanism to help determine the *preferred* primary, so that work is routed correctly.

Likewise, when the configuration is changed (especially the primary/replica configuration), it will be important for connected instances to make themselves aware of the new situation (via `INFO`, `CONFIG`, etc - where available). StackExchange.Redis does this by automatically subscribing to a pub/sub channel upon which such notifications may be sent. For similar reasons, this defaults to `"__Booksleeve_MasterChanged"`.

Both options can be customized or disabled (set to `""`), via the `.ConfigurationChannel` and `.TieBreaker` configuration properties.

These settings are also used by the `IServer.MakeMaster()` method, which can set the tie-breaker in the database and broadcast the configuration change message. The configuration message can also be used separately to primary/replica changes simply to request all nodes to refresh their configurations, via the `ConnectionMultiplexer.PublishReconfigure` method.

ReconnectRetryPolicy
---
StackExchange.Redis automatically tries to reconnect in the background when the connection is lost for any reason. It keeps retrying  until the connection has been restored. It would use ReconnectRetryPolicy to decide how long it should wait between the retries.
ReconnectRetryPolicy can be exponential (default), linear or a custom retry policy.


Examples:
```csharp
config.ReconnectRetryPolicy = new ExponentialRetry(5000); // defaults maxDeltaBackoff to 10000 ms
//retry#    retry to re-connect after time in milliseconds
//1	        a random value between 5000 and 5500	   
//2	        a random value between 5000 and 6050	   
//3	        a random value between 5000 and 6655	   
//4	        a random value between 5000 and 8053
//5	        a random value between 5000 and 10000, since maxDeltaBackoff was 10000 ms
//6	        a random value between 5000 and 10000

config.ReconnectRetryPolicy = new LinearRetry(5000);
//retry#    retry to re-connect after time in milliseconds
//1	        5000
//2	        5000 	   
//3	        5000 	   
//4	        5000
//5	        5000
//6	        5000
```
