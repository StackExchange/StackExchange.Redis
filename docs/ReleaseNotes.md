## 2.0.601

- add: tracking for current and next messages to help with debugging timeout issues - helpful in cases of large pipeline blockers

## 2.0.600

- add: `ulong` support to `RedisValue` and `RedisResult` (#1103)
- fix: remove odd equality: `"-" != 0` (we do, however, still allow `"-0"`, as that is at least semantically valid, and is logically `== 0`) (related to #1103)
- performance: rework how pub/sub queues are stored - reduces delegate overheads (related to #1101)
- fix #1108 - ensure that we don't try appending log data to the `TextWriter` once we've returned from a method that accepted one

## 2.0.593

- performance: unify spin-wait usage on sync/async paths to one competitor
- fix #1101 - when a `ChannelMessageQueue` is involved, unsubscribing *via any route* should still unsubscribe and mark the queue-writer as complete

## 2.0.588

- stability and performance: resolve intermittent stall in the write-lock that could lead to unexpected timeouts even when at low/reasonable (but concurrent) load

## 2.0.571

- performance: use new [arena allocation API](https://mgravell.github.io/Pipelines.Sockets.Unofficial/docs/arenas) to avoid `RawResult[]` overhead
- performance: massively simplified how `ResultBox<T>` is implemented, in particular to reduce `TaskCompletionSource<T>` allocations
- performance: fix sync-over-async issue with async call paths, and fix the [SemaphoreSlim](https://blog.marcgravell.com/2019/02/fun-with-spiral-of-death.html) problems that this uncovered
- performance: re-introduce the unsent backlog queue, in particular to improve async performance
- performance: simplify how completions are reactivated, so that external callers use their originating pool, not the dedicated IO pools (prevent thread stealing)
- fix: update Pipelines.Sockets.Unofficial to prevent issue with incorrect buffer re-use in corner-case
- fix: `KeyDeleteAsync` could, in some cases, always use `DEL` (instead of `UNLINK`)
- fix: last unanswered write time was incorrect
- change: use higher `Pipe` thresholds when sending

## 2.0.519

- adapt to late changes in the RC streams API (#983, #1007)
- documentation fixes (#997, #1005)
- build: switch to SDK 2.1.500

## 2.0.513

- fix #961 - fix assembly binding redirect problems; IMPORTANT: this drops to an older `System.Buffers` version - if you have manually added redirects for `4.0.3.0`, you may need to manually update to `4.0.2.0` (or remove completely)
- fix #962 - avoid NRE in edge-case when fetching bridge

## 2.0.505

- fix #943 - ensure transaction inner tasks are completed prior to completing the outer transaction task
- fix #946 - reinstate missing `TryParse` methods on `RedisValue`
- fix #940 - off-by-one on pre-boxed integer cache (NRediSearch)

## 2.0.495

- 2.0 is a large - and breaking - change

The key focus of this release is stability and reliability.

- HARD BREAK: the package identity has changed; instead of `StackExchange.Redis` (not strong-named) and `StackExchange.Redis.StrongName` (strong-named), we are now
  only releasing `StackExchange.Redis` (strong-named). This is a binary breaking change that requires consumers to be re-compiled; it cannot be applied via binding-redirects
- HARD BREAK: the platform targets have been rationalized - supported targets are .NETStandard 2.0 (and above), .NETFramework 4.6.1 (and above), and .NETFramework 4.7.2 (and above)
  (note - the last two are mainly due to assembly binding problems)
- HARD BREAK: the profiling API has been overhauled and simplified; full documentation is [provided here](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Profiling_v2.html)
- SOFT BREAK: the `PreserveAsyncOrder` behaviour of the pub/sub API has been deprecated; a *new* API has been provided for scenarios that require in-order pub/sub handling -
  the `Subscribe` method has a new overload *without* a handler parameter which returns a `ChannelMessageQueue`, which provides `async` ordered access to messsages)
- internal: the network architecture has moved to use `System.IO.Pipelines`; this has allowed us to simplify and unify a lot of the network code, and in particular 
  fix a lot of problems relating to how the library worked with TLS and/or .NETStandard
- change: as a result of the `System.IO.Pipelines` change, the error-reporting on timeouts is now much simpler and clearer; the [timeouts documentation](Timeouts.md) has been updated
- removed: the `HighPriority` (queue-jumping) flag is now deprecated
- internal: most buffers internally now make use of pooled memory; `RedisValue` no longer pre-emptively allocates buffers
- internal: added new custom thread-pool for handling async continuations to avoid thread-pool starvation issues
- internal: all IL generation has been removed; the library should now work on platforms that do not allow runtime-emit
- added: asynchronous operations now have full support for reporting timeouts
- added: new APIs now exist to work with pooled memory without allocations - `RedisValue.CreateFrom(MemoryStream)` and `operator` support for `Memory<byte>` and `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`; and `IDatabase.StringGetLease[Async](...)`, `IDatabase.HashGetLease[Async](...)`, `Lease<byte>.AsStream()`)
- added: ["streams"](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro) support (thanks to [ttingen](https://github.com/ttingen) for their contribution)
- various missing commands / overloads have been added; `Execute[Async]` for additional commands is now available on `IServer`
- fix: a *lot* of general bugs and issues have been resolved
- ACCIDENTAL BREAK: `RedisValue.TryParse` was accidentally ommitted in the overhaul; this has been rectified and will be available in the next build

a more complete list of issues addressed can be seen in [this tracking issue](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/issues/871)

Note: we currently have no plans to do an additional 1.* release. In particular, even though there was a `1.2.7-alpha` build on nuget, we *do not* currently have
plans to release `1.2.7`.
