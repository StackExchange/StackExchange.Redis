## 2.5.27 (prerelease)

- Adds: a backlog/retry mechanism for commands issued while a connection isn't available ([#1912 by NickCraver](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/pull/1912))
  - Commands will be queued if a multiplexer isn't yet connected to a Redis server.
  - Commands will be queued if a connection is lost and then sent to the server when the connection is restored.
  - All commands queued will only remain in the backlog for the duration of the configured timeout.
  - To revert to previous behavior, a new `ConfigurationOptions.BacklogPolicy` is available - old behavior is configured via `options.BacklogPolicy = BacklogPolicy.FailFast`. This backlogs nothing and fails commands immediately if no connection is available.

- Stability: Fixed potential disposed object usage around Arenas (pulling in [Piplines.Sockets.Unofficial#63](https://github.com/mgravell/Pipelines.Sockets.Unofficial/pull/63) by MarcGravell)
- Adds: Thread pool work item stats to exception messages to help diagnose contention ([#1964 by NickCraver](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/pull/1964))
- Fix/Performance: Overhauls pub/sub implementation for correctness ([#1947 by NickCraver](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/pull/1947))
  - Fixes a race in subscribing right after connected
  - Fixes a race in subscribing immediately before a publish
  - Fixes subscription routing on clusters (spreading instead of choosing 1 node)
  - More correctly reconnects subscriptions on connection failures, including to other endpoints
- Adds "(vX.X.X)" version suffix to the default client ID so server-side `CLIENT LIST` can more easily see what's connected ([#1985 by NickCraver](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/pull/1985))

- Performance: Rework how pub/sub queues are stored - reduces delegate overheads (related to [#1101](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/issues/1101))

## 2.0.495

2.0 is a large - and breaking - change. The key focus of this release is stability and reliability.

- **Hard Break**: The package identity has changed; instead of `StackExchange.Redis` (not strong-named) and `StackExchange.Redis.StrongName` (strong-named), we are now
  only releasing `StackExchange.Redis` (strong-named). This is a binary breaking change that requires consumers to be re-compiled; it cannot be applied via binding-redirects
- **Hard Break**: The platform targets have been rationalized - supported targets are .NETStandard 2.0 (and above), .NETFramework 4.6.1 (and above), and .NETFramework 4.7.2 (and above)
  (note - the last two are mainly due to assembly binding problems)
- **Hard Break**: The profiling API has been overhauled and simplified; full documentation is [provided here](https://stackexchange.github.io/StackExchange.Redis/Profiling_v2.html)
- **Soft Break**: The `PreserveAsyncOrder` behaviour of the pub/sub API has been deprecated; a *new* API has been provided for scenarios that require in-order pub/sub handling -
  the `Subscribe` method has a new overload *without* a handler parameter which returns a `ChannelMessageQueue`, which provides `async` ordered access to messages)
- Internal: The network architecture has moved to use `System.IO.Pipelines`; this has allowed us to simplify and unify a lot of the network code, and in particular fix a lot of problems relating to how the library worked with TLS and/or .NETStandard
- Change: As a result of the `System.IO.Pipelines` change, the error-reporting on timeouts is now much simpler and clearer; the [timeouts documentation](Timeouts.md) has been updated
- Removed: The `HighPriority` (queue-jumping) flag is now deprecated
- Internal: Most buffers internally now make use of pooled memory; `RedisValue` no longer preemptively allocates buffers
- Internal: Added new custom thread-pool for handling async continuations to avoid thread-pool starvation issues
- Internal: All IL generation has been removed; the library should now work on platforms that do not allow runtime-emit
- Adds: asynchronous operations now have full support for reporting timeouts
- Adds: new APIs now exist to work with pooled memory without allocations - `RedisValue.CreateFrom(MemoryStream)` and `operator` support for `Memory<byte>` and `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>`; and `IDatabase.StringGetLease[Async](...)`, `IDatabase.HashGetLease[Async](...)`, `Lease<byte>.AsStream()`)
- Adds: ["streams"](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro) support (thanks to [ttingen](https://github.com/ttingen) for their contribution)
- Adds: Various missing commands / overloads have been added; `Execute[Async]` for additional commands is now available on `IServer`
- Fix: A *lot* of general bugs and issues have been resolved
- **Break**: `RedisValue.TryParse` was accidentally omitted in the overhaul; this has been rectified and will be available in the next build

A more complete list of issues addressed can be seen in [this tracking issue](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis/issues/871)

Note: we currently have no plans to do an additional `1.*` release. In particular, even though there was a `1.2.7-alpha` build on nuget, we *do not* currently have plans to release `1.2.7`.
