# Unit Testing

Unit testing is great! Yay, do more of that!

This type is provided for external unit testing, in particular by people using modules or server features
not directly implemented by SE.Redis - for example to verify messsage parsing or formatting without
talking to a RESP server.

These types are considered slightly more... *mercurial*. We encourage you to use them, but *occasionally*
(not just for fun) you might need to update your test code if we tweak something. This should not impact
"real" library usage.

```xml
<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SER005</NoWarn>
```

or more granularly / locally in C#:

``` c#
#pragma warning disable SER005
```
