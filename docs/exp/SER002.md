Redis 8.4 is currently in preview and may be subject to change.

New features in Redis 8.4 include:

- [`MSETEX`](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14434) for setting multiple strings with expiry
- [`XREADGROUP ... CLAIM`](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14402) for simplifed stream consumption
- [`SET ... {IFEQ|IFNE|IFDEQ|IFDNE}`, `DELEX` and `DIGEST`](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/14434) for checked (CAS/CAD) string operations

The corresponding library feature must also be considered subject to change:

1. Existing bindings may cease working correctly if the underlying server API changes.
2. Changes to the server API may require changes to the library API, manifesting in either/both of build-time
   or run-time breaks.

While this seems *unlikely*, it must be considered a possibility. If you acknowledge this, you can suppress
this warning by adding the following to your `csproj` file:

```xml
<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SER002</NoWarn>
```

or more granularly / locally in C#:

``` c#
#pragma warning disable SER002
```
