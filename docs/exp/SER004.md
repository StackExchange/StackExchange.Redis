# RESPite

RESPite is an experimental library that provides high-performance low-level RESP (Redis, etc) parsing and serialization.
It is used as the IO core for StackExchange.Redis v3+. You should not (yet) use it directly unless you have a very
good reason to do so.

```xml
<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SER004</NoWarn>
```

or more granularly / locally in C#:

``` c#
#pragma warning disable SER004
```
