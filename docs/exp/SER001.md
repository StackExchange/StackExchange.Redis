At the current time, [Redis documents that](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/vadd/):

> Vector set is a new data type that is currently in preview and may be subject to change.

As such, the corresponding library feature must also be considered subject to change:

1. Existing bindings may cease working correctly if the underlying server API changes.
2. Changes to the server API may require changes to the library API, manifesting in either/both of build-time
   or run-time breaks. 

While this seems *unlikely*, it must be considered a possibility. If you acknowledge this, you can suppress
this warning by adding the following to your `csproj` file:

```xml
<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);SER001</NoWarn>
```

or more granularly / locally in C#:

``` c#
#pragma warning disable SER001
```
