# Queue — interpolated RESP writer / client-side caching

Working list for the `marc/interpolated-writer-design` branch. Kept separate from
`interpolated-resp-writer.md` so it can be edited without conflicting with the design notes, which are
long and appended to constantly.

**Convention:** items move to Done with the commit that closed them. Anything removed rather than done gets
a line saying why, because "we decided not to" is worth as much as "we did".

## Framing: this is V4, and the two implementations never run in parallel

Decided 2026-09-15, and it changes how several items below should be read. The spike is not a parallel
alternative that might ship - it is the next major version's core, and the old implementation goes.

Four consequences, none of them cosmetic:

1. **The old `IDatabase` surface still exists; the old *implementation* does not.** Binary compatibility is
   paramount here, so the signatures stay and are served by the new core. That makes the internal
   `...Array` siblings **permanent**, not transitional - their doc comments currently say "goes when the
   old one does", which is now only true if the old *API* ever goes, which it may not.

2. **`Fallback<T>()` must reach zero.** `TransitionalDatabase` currently delegates transactions to
   `RedisDatabase`. With nothing to delegate to, `MULTI`/`WATCH`/`HIMPORT`/`EVALSHA` stop being acceptable
   permanent residue and become **release blockers**. Deferring them is a temporary state with a mandatory
   exit, not an end state.

3. **The `Message` layer is load-bearing, and a second write path is not merely unattractive - it is
   incoherent.** The backlog is one `ConcurrentQueue<Message>` per bridge, and `FrameMessage : Message`, so
   frames *already* participate in ordering, backlog replay, retry accounting and the reconnect handshake.
   Two owners of one socket's write path cannot share any of those. So "build a raw executor beside the
   shim" is not an option at all, and the shim is not a hack to escape - it is what lets frames have those
   properties for free.

   **Which means the vexing commands need composition, not a new path.** Both mechanisms already exist in
   that layer: `IMultiMessage` (one logical message expanding into several, written as a unit - this is how
   `TransactionMessage` does MULTI/EXEC today) and write-lock injection (a connection-local preamble decided
   once the connection is known - this is how `HashImport` does PREPARE). What the frame surface lacks is a
   frame-shaped participant in each. That is a far smaller and strictly additive piece of work than a raw
   executor, and none of MOVED/ASK, backlog, timeouts, retry, profiling or high-integrity has to be
   reimplemented, because we never leave the path that already has them.

4. **`[Experimental]` is a staging label, not a hedge.** "We can change it later because it is
   experimental" stops being true. Public shapes - lease returns, group names, `Keys` over `Keyspace` -
   are effectively permanent from here, which raises the value of settling them now and lowers the value of
   leaving options open. SER352's 354 members stop being a progress bar and become a release gate, which
   is what the Release-build warning was asked for in the first place.

## Now

- [ ] **Two cacheability calls wanting a second opinion.** `DUMP` (a serialised payload - stable for a
      given value, and invalidated like any other read, so arguably fine) and `HPEXPIRETIME`, which is
      currently left *cacheable* on the grounds that an absolute instant does not drift, where `HPTTL`
      counts down and is stale the moment it is stored. The rest of the exclusion list is done. `TOUCH` and
      `PFCOUNT` are not on the new surface yet; when the `Keys` group lands, `TOUCH` needs `.NeverCached()`.

## Next

- [ ] **Teach the in-proc server `CLIENT TRACKING`** (`toys/StackExchange.Redis.Server`), for test
      isolation: the cache suite currently needs a shared 6379, where one test's `FLUSHDB` reaches every
      other test's tracking connection. Most of the seams already exist - `RespServer.Touch(db, key)` is
      already a virtual broadcast to every client on every non-readonly key access, `node.OnOutOfBand`
      already delivers pushes for pub/sub, `TypedRedisValue.Rent(n, out span, PushKind)` builds the frame,
      and the writer already handles `RespPrefix.Push when value.IsNullArray`, which is the flush shape.
      New: parse `CLIENT TRACKING ON|OFF [BCAST] [PREFIX p ...]` into per-client state, and fan out.

      **Timing is the part to get right, and it is measured rather than guessed (6.13).** Key
      invalidations are *accumulated across the write cycle* and emitted **after** the replies - two
      pipelined `SET`s produce one two-key push after both `+OK`s - so the fake needs an accumulator
      flushed at the end of a batch, not a send inside `Touch`. `FLUSHDB` is the exception: its
      `invalidate null` goes out **before** its own `+OK` - though the fake may emit it after, and that
      is a deliberate, recorded divergence rather than an oversight: the ordering only matters to the client
      doing the flushing, which has already called `OnFlush` locally, and everyone else receives it
      unsolicited where ordering means nothing.

      Per-key (non-`BCAST`) mode is nearly as cheap - `OnKey` already runs per key with a `ReadOnly` flag -
      and is worth having because it is the mode whose "server forgets the key once it has told you"
      behaviour the `NOLOOP` argument rests on.


- [ ] **`Parse(ref RespReader)`, and the row-parser collapse** (§2.2, §6.16). Now with evidence rather
      than a hunch: converting the arrays produced **16 handlers that are all "aggregate of X"** - eight
      array, eight lease - of which six differ only by a one-line projection, which is why they were
      factored onto a shared `ReadScalarLease`. With `Parse(ref RespReader)` the row parser *is* the scalar
      handler: `IRespHandler<long>` for `INCR` does `ReadInt64()`, and so does the row parser for
      `ReadOnlyLease<long>`. `double?` is character-for-character identical. So registration becomes
      **implement the element handler, get the aggregate/lease/array for free** - the natural extension of
      "registration is implementing the interface", and the story for module types.

      **Jagged vs interleaved belongs in the walker, not the row parser.** `HashEntry`/`SortedSetEntry`
      look like exceptions because a row is two interleaved elements in RESP2 and one nested array in
      RESP3 - but the old parser already hides that from its implementers entirely: `ParseArray` decides
      `isJagged` once per reply and runs one of two loops that both call the same `Parse(ref first, ref
      second, state)`. So the generic walker normalises, the row parser declares an **arity** (1 for
      scalars, 2 for pairs), and all eight collapse rather than six. Carry the escape hatch across too:
      `AllowJaggedPairs` is `protected virtual`, and `RedisStreamInterleavedProcessor` overrides it to
      false because it works on an already-flattened map.

      The shape is endemic - `HGETALL`, `ZRANGE WITHSCORES`, `XRANGE`, `CONFIG GET` - so hoisting it once
      pays on every group added, and leaving it per-handler means re-deriving the jagged check each time.

      A refactor that **deletes** code. Deliberately sequenced after the signature change: the public
      shapes were binary-breaking and time-limited, the handler internals are internal and can be
      collapsed whenever without touching a caller.

- [ ] **`CLIENT TRACKING` negotiation in the real client.** RESP3-only; the mode and prefixes now come
      from `CacheOptions.TrackingMode` / `CacheOptions.Prefixes`, which are already validated against each
      other (§6.13). Must refuse **loudly** when RESP3 is unavailable rather than silently caching without
      invalidation, and the `PREFIX` arguments must come from `CachePolicy.Prefixes` rather than a second
      list — the cache already refuses keys outside that set, so the two drifting apart would mean either
      caching what nothing announces, or refusing what something does.
      **Now the only thing left between `ClientCache` and a cache that works by itself:**
      hosting and routing are done, so a caller who sets the policy and never issues `CLIENT TRACKING`
      gets a cache that fills, expires on TTL, and is never invalidated — the exact silent-wrongness this
      item exists to prevent. Until it lands, `ConfigurationOptions.ClientCache` is experimental in the
      strong sense.

- [ ] **The rest of the `Execute` family on `TransitionalDatabase`.** `ExecuteResp`/`ExecuteRespAsync` are
      done (a pass-through; the signatures agree exactly). `Execute`/`ExecuteAsync` returning `RedisResult`
      need a `RespResult` -> `RedisResult` step, for which `RespReaderExtensions.ReadRedisResult` already
      exists. The `object[]`/`ICollection<object>` overloads lose key-ness to boxing, so they cannot cache;
      that is a property of the old signature, not something to fix here.

- [ ] **`StringGetLease` and the legacy-lease pattern.** The shape to follow: the new surface produces
      `ReadOnlyLease<byte>` (which may share), and the legacy adapter converts to `Lease<byte>` — a copy,
      honestly, because the legacy contract promises the caller owns the bytes. That conversion wants a
      pooled `ToLease()` on `ReadOnlyLease<T>` rather than `ToArray()`, which allocates outside the pool.
      Not added yet, deliberately: no caller, no API.

- [ ] **More command groups**, in `RespSurface.<Group>.cs` + `TransitionalDatabase.<Group>.cs` pairs.
      Mechanical now; `Strings` and `Bitmaps` are the worked examples. SER352 counts what is left.

- [ ] **The `OBJECT` family and `DBSIZE`.** Deferred out of the `Keys` group: `OBJECT ENCODING/REFCOUNT/
      FREQ/IDLETIME` are a different command shape, better done together, and `IDLETIME` will want
      `.NeverCached()` for the same reason `PTTL` does. `DBSIZE` is an `IServer` command and belongs to
      that context, not to `Keys`.

## Later / decide first

- [ ] **Per-context `CachePolicy` override** (`WithCachePolicy`). The other half of the options/policy
      split: policy settings are read-time, so they can vary per call, and the override rides in the
      context's service slot exactly as `MaxCacheAgeService` does. `WithMaxCacheAge` stays as the
      ergonomic spelling of the common case rather than being subsumed.
      One wrinkle: `InvalidationGracePeriod` is not purely read-time. Whether grace is on gates a
      timestamp *write* in the invalidation path, which sees every key the server mentions. So arming it
      belongs on `CacheOptions` and only the duration can vary per context.

- [ ] **`IServer` / `ISubscriber` contexts** still throw from `IRespTarget.Context`.

- [ ] **The retry executor** (`WithRetry`). Prerequisites in place; no design written.

- [ ] **Should the existing `ResultProcessor` path copy too?** (§6.16). Sharing there is *correct* — it is
      single-owner — so this is a policy change, not a fix, and it would strand `TryReservePayload`,
      `IPayloadReservationProvider` and `PayloadReservation` as dead code now that `ReadLease` (read-only)
      is their only remaining consumer. Own merits or not at all.

- [ ] **Module-read tracking.** Do module reads register for invalidation? A five-minute experiment
      against a real server, never run. Relevant because the docs put the whole `FT.*` family outside
      server-side tracking — though a prefix list that names data keys already excludes index names, so
      the exposure now requires someone to have declared a prefix covering them.

- [ ] **`RespContext` sizing.** Currently 48 bytes. `CachePolicy` rides on the cache and the freshness
      override rides in the service slot, so nothing has grown it yet — but SWR adds knobs, and the
      measurement that justified moving `ChannelPrefix` out (§3.3) should be repeated rather than assumed.

## Decided against

- **A "buffer is shared" flag on `RespReader`**, and a second read-only reservation interface. Unnecessary
  once the *type* carries the distinction: the mutable path simply never calls `TryReservePayload`. §6.16.
- **`ReadOnlyLease<byte>` as a `struct`.** `RefCountedBuffer.Release()` is a bare decrement with no
  idempotence guard, so a copied-and-disposed-twice struct would return a live buffer to the pool while
  other holders still read it.
- **`NOLOOP` on `CLIENT TRACKING`.** In default mode the server stops tracking a key we wrote even when it
  suppresses the message, so anything whose key set we under-declare (`EVAL` with computed keys) goes
  *permanently* stale rather than briefly. §6.13.
- **Sharing a buffer into a `RedisValue`.** Tempting, because single-value replies are a large cohort and
  they are exactly the ones a cache serves. But `RedisValue` has no disposal, so it can never give a
  reference back — which leaves only "pin the buffer forever" or "let the pool reclaim it while the value
  still points at it". That is not a gap to be plugged; it is the absence of a lifetime, and `RespResult`
  exists because it *has* one.

- **Deriving `BCAST PREFIX` from `WithKeyPrefix`.** Prefixes are connection-global, must not overlap —
  context prefixes routinely nest — and cannot be removed individually. §6.13.
